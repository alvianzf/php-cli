# Tick PHP

A light-weight PHP framework that I worked from scratch as a side project.

Built using symphony (composer) and some inspiration from Laravel and Codeigniter 3.

## To start
Start by using dumping the Autoload into yout project  
`composer dump-autoload`  

You can run the application by using  
`php tick`  
  
or specify the port by using the `--port` attribute  
`php tick --port 3000`
